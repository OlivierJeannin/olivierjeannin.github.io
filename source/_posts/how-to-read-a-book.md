Split the material into ***chunks***.

Finish the procedure for each chunk, then move on to the next chunk.

# Skim for an Overview

Look only at titles, subtitles, some keywords and probably summaries.

The purpose is to get a whole overview of the material you are reading. Look, when you are in a new place, you can't expect to know where is where without a *lay* of it, can you?

# Ask Questions on the Topic

You must be curious about the topic!

For those who are, questions are unstoppable. "Is he going to talk about that thing?"

If it is not exciting to you, try to link it with something is. You may find that there are lots of usages of physics when playing baseball.

You can write down these questions.

# Read

Visualise information as much as possible.

All texts are just a description of a series of phenomina, and you want to see them with your own eyes.

# Take Notes

- Take notes after reading a whole paragraph to get the entire idea.
- Don't do it as a job. Do it for fun.
- Write whatever you want, e.g. short sumary of the idea, questions not answered, your observations, your opinion, etc.

Notes are just tools to help you, not the purpose itself.

When you totally focus on reading, your brain will automatically pick up the most important thing for you, so all you have to do is enjoy your reading and keep your flow.

Don't worry about forgetting, because it's not the right time. It is *after* reading and note-taking when we'll check how much we remember and how we can memorise more.

# Recall

Don't look at the material, recall what you've just read and write a summary in your own words. Check how well you memorise.

If you took your questions down as mentioned before, then you've got small quizzes to do the check! Go and take it!

# Review

According to the Ebbinghaus Forgetting Curve, in first few days, you have to review what you learned every few hours every day. Then review them every few days, then every few weeks, then maybe never.

The intensity is less, as you remember the same knowlegde better.

{% note info Things to keep in mind:%}

1. Outline first, details second.

2. Visualise while reading.

3. Keep your notes in your own words.

4. If you don't understand something you read, Ask Somebody. It may take you hours, but it takes only a word for those who know.
5. Don't give up. You may think it slow to do so much work reading so little, but you'll find it saves you much more time when you have your notes without having to re-read the book all over again just to find that tiny bit of information you forgot. In fact, you'll learn so well that reviewing for exams will take you little time.

# What happened before this blog

In fact, two years ago, I did try to keep a blog site and I worked really heard to learn how to do it well, though I did not actually get the key point and gave it up.

During this summer vacation, which has just passed, I reviewed my earlier work and found it a piece of sh\*t... So I just spent a while to learn once again to build a blog from scratch and tried around, and finally, I could write a decent piece and kicked the blog off.

# What & Why I would write

At this small site of mine, you will see, some notes on what I am learning at school, some notes on what I'm learning off school, my random thoughts, and so on, just whatever I think is worth sharing.

I take these things down mainly to stop me from learning without any reviewing and forgetting everything I've got to know for probablly just 2 months. You know, recalling is a great way to memorize information. And I also hope that blogging would make me a good note-taker. Apparently, I can practise some note-taking skills on it.

You may find that some of my posts are marked with a rather early time. They might be posted in 2018, and edited in 2021. That's because they are my early pieces posted somewhere else, and I collected them after this site was built. I want everything of mine filed and kept in one place.

# Last

At last, I want whoever may see this blog to find something useful and enjoy it. We may not know each other, but I still find it satisfied should I be helpful to anyone.

***Wish you a good day,***

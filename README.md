# Orion - My Personal Blog

This repository is my personal blog, named Orion, generated by Hexo.

There are 2 branches, **master** and **src**.

- **master**: contains Hexo-generated webpages and .html files for my blog site.
- **src**: is where I keep a copy of my Hexo and theme settings, article templates, and actual articles in .md format

Welcome to read my [blog](https://olivierjeannin.github.io/) and have fun!

# Orion - My Personal Blog

This repository is my personal blog, named Orion, generated by Hexo.

There are 2 branches, **master** and **src**.

- **master**: contains Hexo-generated webpages and .html files for my blog site.
  - Any changes you make on source files CANNOT be merged into this branch.

- **src**: is where I keep a copy of my Hexo and theme settings, article templates, and actual articles in .md format.
  - Capitalised name of a directory indicates a category of articles in by blog.
  - A non-capitalised name means it is the asset directory linked to an article.


Welcome to read my [blog](https://olivierjeannin.github.io/) and have fun!
